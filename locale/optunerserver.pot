"This plugin implements the Tuner Server feature included. It will allow you to share the tuners of this box with another STB, PC and/or another compatible device in your home network.\n"
"The server will build a virtual channels list in the folder /media/usb/tuner on this box.\n"
"You can access the tuner(s) of this box from clients on your internal lan using nfs, cifs, UPnP or any other network mountpoint.\n"
"The tuner of the server (this box) has to be avaliable. This means that if you have ony one tuner in your box you can only stream the channel you are viewing (or any channel you choose if your box is in standby).\n"
"Remember to select the correct audio track in the audio menu if there is no audio or the wrong language is streaming.\n"
"NOTE: The server is built, based on your current ip and the current channel list of this box. If you change your ip or your channel list is updated, you will need to rebuild the server database.\n"
